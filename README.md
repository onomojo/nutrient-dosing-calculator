# Nutrient Dosing Calculator

The purpose of this project is to create an accurate and well tested nutrient / fertilzier dosing calculator for planted aquariums. It has been a struggle to find an accurate dosing calculator online. Existing solutions either have incorrect math, hidden formulas, or untested math which makes it very difficult to trust any other solutions. We aim for transparency in all the forumlas as well as having our calculations tested to ensure their accuracy.
